      <p>
        Somethings about me, I have always loved sports and video games. When
        I'm not at work or doing schoolwork, I'm usually doing some sort of
        combo of playing video games and watching or playing sports with
        friends. I love dogs, I have 2 wonderful dogs that I love.
