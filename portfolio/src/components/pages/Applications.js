          Every week during the full stack bootcamp I have taken, we have had
          different challenges we were tasked with completing for each
          corresponding unit. Following below, is some examples that I have
          selected to include in my portfolio. You will be presented with a
          screenshot or short video of a developed application, a link to said
          application, and the corresponding repository where you can view all
          of my code for each application.

          During our first week, we learned all the ins and outs of HTML and
          some CSS. We were tasked with going through some existing code, and
          picking it apart to remove uneccessary repitition to downsize the
          amount of pointless code present in the application.
